# Quantum trajectory guided Gauss-Hermite basis 

The {q,p} evolutes as a classical trajectory in QtVP.py 
and Ehrenfest trajectory in QtVP_Ehrenfest.py 

Approximations 
--------------

 The width of GWP is adjusted using Local Harmonic Approximation 
 And also the phase factor (imaginary part of width parameter)
