Quantum Trajectory Method needs approximations to so-called quantum potential, which needs the full wavefunction to 
obtain exact values. 

Several approximations have been developed. 

-----------------------
LQF:  Linear Quantum Force (LQF) : developed by Garashchuk and Rassolov, approximates quantum force as a linear function of coordinates 
 
QTM_MPI : Parallel version of QTM (with friction), can be used to compute the ground-state wavefunction of any system with pairwise potential

KDE : kernal density estimate
