Quantum Trajectory Method needs approximations to so-called quantum potential, which needs the full wavefunction to 
obtain exact values. 

Several approximations have been developed. 

- Linear Quantum Force (LQF) : developed by Garashchuk and Rassolov, approximates quantum force as a linear function of coordinates
