# pyQMD
Quantum molecular dynamics simulated with various methods implemented with PYTHON and Fortran.

It consists of various different formulations of quantum mechanics and approximation associated within each formulation. 


## Wave mechanics 
 - Exact numerical method - split-operator method and Fast Fourier Transform 
 - Discrete variable representation (DVR) 
 
## Quantum Trajecotry Method (QTM)/Bohmian Mechanics 
- Real-time quantum wavepacket dynamics 
- Imaginary-time quantum wavepacket propagation 

## Quantum trajectory method with friction (QTM_F) 


## Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) 
Imaginary-time propagation of arbitrary wavefunction 
- Variational Monte Carlo 
- Diffusion Monte Carlo  


## Path Integral

## Quantum dynamics with Gaussian wavepackets (GWP) 

 - Quantum trajectory guided GWPs 

## TDSE with Gauss-Hermite basis  guided by quantum trajectories (GHQT)
