# pyQMD
Quantum molecular dynamics simulated with various methods implemented with PYTHON.

It will consist of various different formulations of quantum mechanics and approximation associated within each formulation. 


## Wave mechanics 
 - Exact numerical method - split-operator method and Fast Fourier Transform 
 
## Bohmian Mechanics 
- Real-time quantum wavepacket dynamics 
- Imaginary-time quantum wavepacket propagation 

## Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) 
Imaginary-time propagation of arbitrary wavefunction 
- Variational Monte Carlo 
- Diffusion Monte Carlo  


## Path Integral
