## Scitools

Scitools is a package created for scientists working in diver field of quantum mechanics including quantum dynamics, perodically driven quantum systems, open quantum systems and electronic and optical properties of matter.


## Quantum dynamics 
 - Exact numerical method - split-operator method and Fast Fourier Transform 
 - Discrete variable representation (DVR) 
 
## Quantum Trajecotry Method (QTM)/Bohmian Mechanics 
- Real-time quantum wavepacket dynamics 
- Imaginary-time quantum wavepacket propagation 

## Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) 
Imaginary-time propagation of arbitrary wavefunction 
- Variational Monte Carlo 
- Diffusion Monte Carlo  

## Quantum dynamics with Gaussian wavepackets (GWP) 

 - Quantum trajectory guided GWPs
