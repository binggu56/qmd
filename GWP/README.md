trajectory guided-gaussian basis 
===

Bing Gu 

### 1.1.1
- try scattering system again 

# 1.1.0 
- try to resolve ill-condition of gaussian overlap matrix with repulsive force 

For the width of GWP basis 
  - has to be large enough to describe the wavefunction broading 
  - has to be small enough to make the local harmonic approximation accurate
